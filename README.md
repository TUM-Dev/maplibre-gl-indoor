# MapLibreGL Indoor Plugin

This is a heavily modified version of [map-gl-indoor](https://github.com/map-gl-indoor/map-gl-indoor).
It
- strips out mapbox support
- moves to a newer version of maplibre
- fixes compatability issues with maplibre, such as not being able to select levels

It is first and foremost designed to facilitate vector based rooms in [NavigaTUM](https://github.com/TUM-Dev/Navigatum).
Maybe in the future this will be build out as a full library fork, but for now this is just a "internal" open source library fork.
If you like us to publish it on npm, please file an issue against NavigaTUM
